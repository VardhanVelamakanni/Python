#loops are used to repeat instructions
#While loop
#for example lets take a example and print hello 5 times
#print("hello")
#print("hello")
#print("hello")
#print("hello")
#print("hello")
#which sort of helps for some lines,but for things to be printed for 1lakh times or more than that the file readability will be decreased and the file storage will be more with i lakh code lines
#hence for this for and while loop helps a lot
#example
count = 1
while count <=5:
    print("hello")
    count += 1
